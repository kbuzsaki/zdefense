### Progress
- Combined enemy sprite drawing logic to one project/filebase. Will work from
  this from now on.
- Implemented data structures for storing enemy data.
- Implemented animated enemy movement across the map path using a combination
  of sprite animations that move within cells and periodic cell level movement
  to give the appearance of pixel level movement.
- Refactored large resulting codebase into multiple files to prepare for group
  work on the larger project.
- Laid plans out for Tower storage structure

### Plans for next week
Continue work on next steps for project:
- Extend enemy code to support multiple types of enemies
- Implement scripted "enemy spawning" so that enemies appear at the start of the path
- Implement tower level data structures and tower building
- Start on tower shooting animation planning
- Design and implement parts of the interface in the lower third of the screen
